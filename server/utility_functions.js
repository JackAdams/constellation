// This function takes three data points into account:

// 1) the actual document as it stands on the server, prior to being updated
// 2) the oldData that was on the client before the user pressed save
// 3) the newData that the client is trying to save

// This function decides which fields it is going to make writes to on this basis:
// 1) The field(s) being overwritten must appear in the db doc and on the client oldData
//    (if they only appear in the oldData these must have been added dynamically on the client
//     and we don't want to save these fields to the db)
//    -- this includes fields that are being removed (i.e. they must appear in the db doc and the oldData)
// 2) Only fields that appear in the newData, but not the oldData or db doc can be added
//    (if it appears in the db doc, throw an error that says:
//     "There is an unpublished field in the database with that name. Update cannot be made.")

// The ramifications of all this:
// You can only update/remove fields that are published
// You can only add new fields if they don't exist in the db already
